# DroneVision-Analytics
This project uses YOLO for person detection in drone-captured images. It focuses on aerial perspectives.

## Notes on the Original Project
This project is based on a previous work from which inspiration was obtained through a video. It has been adapted and modified for proper execution in Google Colab, allowing for more accessible use without complex local configurations.

## Project Usage
This project is designed for counting people in different open space environments. It focuses on detecting and analyzing the flow of people using computer vision techniques.

### Applications
The purpose of this code is to count and analyze the number of people in open spaces over time. This can be used for various analytical studies such as:
- Monitoring attendance at public events.
- Managing the flow of people in urban spaces.
- Analyzing movement patterns in specific areas.

### Requirements
To use this project, you need:
- An environment compatible with Google Colab.
- Updated libraries, including OpenCV, NumPy, and other dependencies required for person detection.
- Images or videos in an eagle-eye view to enable proper people detection.

# About the Code
## Code Update
The code has been updated to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of the libraries used. Due to changes in the functions and parameters of OpenCV and other dependencies, adjustments have been made to the implementation to ensure proper functionality.
